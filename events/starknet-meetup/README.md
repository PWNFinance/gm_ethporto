synopsis:
  - To keep the momentum going after the Starkware Sessions 2023 in Tel Aviv, and last year's StarknetCC in Lisbon, we decided to bootstrap a community event here in Portugal.
  - We decided to start by organizing the first edition on the 15th March, the day before ETH Porto, so we can maybe inspire a couple of hackers to build something awesome on Starknet for the hackathon.
  - After the talks, we'll have a couple of beers and some snacks, so we can get a moment to meet people, eat, drink, and have a good time!
