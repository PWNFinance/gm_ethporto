### INSTRUCTIONS ###
####################
# This file is a template to create new events. In order to use it, duplicate
# the whole folder (/template) as a new folder (I.E. /my-event-name) inside of
# the /events folder, using for the folder name _only_:
# - lowercase letters
# - hyphens/dashes (-) instead of spaces
# - alphanumeric characters ('a' to 'z', '0' to '9')
# and edit the README.md file inside that new folder just created.
#
# The name of the folder will be used on the URL. Example:
# https://blockchainweek.berlin/my-event-name
#
# _Don't_ rename the new file (README.md), only edit its content.
# _Don't_ remove any text before the colons at the beginning of each line,
# only edit what is after the colon. Example:
# Don't remove the word nor colon on 'description:'
#
# Every line starting with a hash symbol (#) is a comment. It will be ignored
# and can be safely removed, including these instructions.

synopsis:
  - Networking at events is heavy but also very unorganized. We plan to do a side events for networking that are optimized and can activate an effective community around the event. Pre-event match making: People will be free to register and meet online during a speed networking using team dynamics app. This will allow them to meet people randomly and view their profiles beforehand to prioritize who they wish to presentially meet during the event and book times.
  - Event match making booth/room: Our team will be present in the event to facilitate networking areas and can also run a speed dating style musical chairs for people to meet and engage. Booth can stay active throughout the event and we can run one match making time during off times that allows people to engage and have fun. 
  - Post event activity: Since we are from Aveiro, a city 40 mins away from Porto. We can take few interested people for a short lunch with a sight-seeing opportunity to the beautiful Venice of Portugal. 
  - This will be a subscription and interest based thing with a shared fee on the lunch levied on the participants. We will help with tickets and food venue selection.
